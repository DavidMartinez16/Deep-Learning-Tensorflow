# Deep Learning Tensorflow

_The field of artificial intelligence is essentially when machines can do tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses machine learning, where machines can learn by experience and acquire skills without human involvement. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Similarly to how we learn from experience, the deep learning algorithm would perform a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome. We refer to ‘deep learning’ because the neural networks have various (deep) layers that enable learning. Just about any problem that requires “thought” to figure out is a problem deep learning can learn to solve._

## Human Activity Recognition

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging problem yet it needs to be solved. It will mainly be used for eldercare and healthcare as an assistive technology when ensemble with other technologies like Internet of Things(IoT). HAR can be done with the help of sensors, smartphones or images.

The [Dataset](https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php) contains data collected through controlled, laboratory conditions.

### Results

The Convolutional Neural Network is capable of classify all the classes with a 88 % of accuracy, it's important to mention that in order to get a better performance you can use more data or create a deeper neural network as well.
